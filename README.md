You need to download XAMPP with Apache and MYSQL services both online, then head to your local directory, example:
C:\xampp\htdocs\
And you'll unpack the zip file there, named crud (note that everything in this program is case sensitive, so make sure not to make too many changes)

Once you place the folder, open XAMPP and go click ADMIN on MySQL, this will lead you to PhPMyAdmin, click on new on the left, and create a database with the name 'crudoperation', once you create it, click on it and create a table named 'crud', the tables contents are as follows:

ID Primary	int(11)
Name	varchar(100)
EMAIL	varchar(100)
Mobile	varchar(20)
Password	varchar(255)
(PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU COPY WORD FOR WORD)

Navigation of the program should be simple, you have your own database to test, attempt creation, deletion, editing, logging in and out of different users, etc.
